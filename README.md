# Lemon Spotter
This is a test and benchmark suite for MPI.

The intention is to not rely on an entire library, but only incremental steps.

Lemons are both tests that fail, MPI functions that don't do the correct thing and 
bad performance implementations.


# Usage 

To run use the following command: 
```
python lemonspotter.py
```

## Arguments

#### Loading Custom Database:
```-l, --load database_path```
