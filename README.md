# Lemon Spotter
This is a test and benchmark suite for MPI.

The intention is to not rely on an entire library, but only incremental steps.

Lemons are both tests that fail, MPI functions that don't do the correct thing and 
bad performance implementations.

```
python LemonSpotter.py
```

## Arguments
